# CS-458-Blockchain-Term-Project

This repository contains the code for our blockchain term project - Securing Medical Data with Blockchain.

The project architecture can be described as follows:

1. **Smart Contract**: The smart contract is written in Solidity programming language using Remix IDE. The smart contract was deployed to an Ethereum test network for demonstration purposes.
2. **Web Server**: The Web Server, written in Java Spring Boot, facilitates the encrypted transfer of medical records between doctors and patients.
3. **Frontend**: The React frontend manages the doctor-patient registration process and communicates with the smart contract regarding access control policies.

The following video provides a working demo of our system:
